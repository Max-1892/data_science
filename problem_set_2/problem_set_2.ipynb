    "    3. (optional) PDF of hand written sections.\n",
    "2. **All** work is to be your own. This is not a group project. You may, however, use code from the lectures and labs. Provide citations for any code that is not your own. You may also consult Stackoverflow, etc. This is not by any means \"closed book\" or anything like that. Basically, I need to see if *you* learned the concepts from the Labs.\n",
    "3. Add whatever markdown or code cells you need in each part to explain and calculate your answers. Don't just provide answers but explain them as well. **Explain and interpret your results. Explain your decisions.** Why are you picking this procedure? Why are you defining the ROPE to be that size? What does a \"90% Bayesian Confidence Interval\" of (24.5, 27.8) *mean*?"

Create a SQLite3 database of the department specific actions (contracts) and dollar amounts. It should have **two** tables. The first \"contractors\" should have an id (as a primary key) and a global_vendor_name (as a varchar). The second should include an id (primary key), department, actions (number of actions), dollars (dollars obligated) and contractor_id as a foreign key to the contractors table. **Submit your database along with any support files (to create the tables) along with this notebook.**\n",
    "4. Reading the Excel file and creating the database should be automated with no cutting and pasting so that you could regenerate the database for a corrected file or for FY2014 (assuming it had the same format). Both `xlrd` and `openpyxl` are included in Anaconda. (Translating the file from .xls to .xlsx *is* permitted but may not be required).\n",
